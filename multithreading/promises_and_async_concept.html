    ASYNC func : messaging     
    
    to achieve multithreading we use asynchronous functions and callback functions    

-->
<!-- make request to many
REQUEST(ASYNC)=> YES => what I should do : TASK had said yes before later said no : cancel TASK
              => NO => what I should do: call 2nd person 

async func can say yes or no or both

promise - gives one single ans either yes or no
          1 request can give one response

async - sometimes may get 2 responses, when you are using complex --nested
