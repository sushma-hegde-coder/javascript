<!--PROMISE : ajax  -- when u need 100% confirmation on one answer   1:18:33--when to use what
    
    ASYNC func : messaging     -- as and when something happens I need answer.. I need multiple answers
    
    to achieve multithreading we use asynchronous functions and callback functions    

-->

Difference between promise and async function--
<!-- make request to many
REQUEST(ASYNC)=> YES => what I should do : do TASK .. had said yes before later said no : cancel TASK
              => NO => what I should do: call 2nd person 

async func is like a person who says whenever something happens I will tell you .. not reliable
one function gave 2 answers
async func can say yes or no or both .. depending on the situation


promise - confirmation
promise - gives one single ans either yes or no no matter what happens
          1 request can give one response

async - sometimes may get 2 responses, when you are using complex --nested 


in which situation one should use async, when to use promise
